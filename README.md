# Galactic Jumble
A space shooter/bullet dodging game I made to learn Unity and C#.

## Story:
The intergalactic group called the Buckthorn Planet Destruction Group (BPDG) has decided to destroy your planet because you didn't pay your taxes on time.
Grab your spaceship and prevent that!

## Features:
- Multiple unbalanced abilities!
- Semi-random and annoying enemy generation!
- Challenging(?) Bosses!
- Multiple Difficulties!

## Controls:
- Arrow Keys - Movement
- Z - Shoot
- X - Ability

##NOTE: The Godot version of this has been cancelled and I'm switching back to Unity.
